# Mach-II PatternViewLoader Experiment

The purpose of this experiment is to determine if `MachII.framework.viewLoaders.PatternViewLoader` works with Lucee application mappings, or if it needs to be patched with that support.

## Setup
* Run `box package install` to fetch Mach-II
* Create a directory `/tmp/external-views`
* Make a view file at `/tmp/external-views/info.cfm`
* Create a directory `/tmp/external-views/foo`
* Make a view file at `/tmp/external-views/foo/bar.cfm`

## Experimenting
* Run `box server start` to launch a Lucee 5.3 instance
* View /index.cfm?event=showHome
* View /index.cfm?event=showInfo
* Uncomment the PatternViewLoader section in the Mach-II XML
* Experience exception
